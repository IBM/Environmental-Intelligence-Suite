    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks us through the Above Ground Biomass (AGB) point query and gives a brief about how to send a point query to AGB Geospatial APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic query in AGB Geospatial APIs is the point query. Now you'll make a point query with the user interface we are going to get you started with the Geospatial APIs API by using it to do a point query:\n",
    "\n",
    "The below query requests <i>Above Ground Biomass</i> values from Geospatial APIs layer 38000, Above Ground Biomass dataset, for a location somewhere in Castelo, Portugal – the coordinates 38.50/-9.10 (latitude/longitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial APIs returns about 3 rows of data, which are stored in the AGB_df dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "Before starting, you have to install IBM EI Geospatial python SDK using `pip3 install -U ibmpairs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> To run this notebook seamlessly, you have to first configure your Geospatial APIs' credentials in a file named `secrets.ini` in the below format:\n",

    "api.org_id = <Your Geospatial APIs Org ID>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the secrets.ini file at an appropriate relative location of this notebook. For example, as specified in the below config.\n",
