[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](samples/v3/agriculture_ndvi/calculate_ndvi.ipynb) | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to quantify vegetation greenness and is useful in understanding vegetation density and assessing changes in plant health.                                                                                             | Agriculture
[Water and Moisture Detection](samples/v3/agriculture_water_and_moisture_detection/detect_changes_water_moisture_indices.ipynb) | Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) provides a relative indication of the wetness or dryness of an area, helping to identify potential water stress or drought conditions or combustibility levels in fire-prone areas. | Agriculture, Disaster Events
[Sea Rise Risk Prediction](samples/v3/climate_change_tidal_surge/predict_sea_level_rise_risk.ipynb) | Geospatial APIs can help determine the possible regions that come under the threat of rise in sea levels                                                                                                                                                                    | Climate Change, Disaster Events
[Historical Difference AGB](samples/v3/disaster_events_deforestation/calculate_wildfire_impact_agb.ipynb) | Above Ground Biomass (AGB) can be used to find out how much the AGB cover has changed over the years for various use case like measuring deforestation, wildfires etc. | Disaster Events
[TWC Seasonal Forecast Weather Prediction](samples/v3/weather_forecast/forecast_7m_weather_outlook_nyc.ipynb) | TWC Seasonal Forecast (SPFP) provides essential insights into anticipated weather patterns over the coming months, aiding industries in strategic planning and decision-making | Climate Change, Weather Forecast
[Cloud Free Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)](samples/v3/cloudfree_ndvi/monitor_vegetation_ndvi.ipynb) | Cloud Free NDVI provides accurate, continuous data on vegetation health, density, and seasonal changes by eliminating cloud interference in satellite images | Cloud Free Imagery, Agriculture Monitoring
[TWC Seasonal Forecast Weather Prediction Backtesting](samples/v3/weather_forecast/twcPredictionAndActualComparison.ipynb) | This notebook is for backtesting our model's predictions and is designed to extract and visualize weather forecasts using the Monthly seasonal forecasts data and actual weather data from datasets like Prism, Twc, Era5 through the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite(EIS): Geospatial APIs Python SDK (SDK).| Climate Change, Weather Forecast
