    "# Above Ground Biomass (AGB) Queries and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) Catalogue's information and a brief about how to obtain the AGB Data Sets and Data Layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the documentation and samples we provide are built using Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the notebooks, below are the basic requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Environmental Intelligence API credentials stored in EIS_API_KEY, EIS_TENANT_ID (or EIS_CLIENT_ID) and EIS_ORG_ID environment variables\n",
    "* A Python3.7 or higher environment\n",
    "* A Jupyter Notebook environment\n",
    "* The latest ibmpairs pip package installed into your Python3 environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> The notebooks include runnable examples but you need to run them in order from top to bottom. This is because there are some lines of set up code, for example, setting authentication credentials, that only appear in the first code cell. We leave them out in the subsequent cells to avoid clutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Above Ground Biomass Catalogue\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary use case of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) is for calculating historic and future carbon units & CO2 capture based on different data layers to generate baseline and predictive results. Above Ground Biomass (AGB) data is generated using GFM models along with data required to create Above Ground Biomass (AGB) predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above Ground Biomass has a Data Set (ID = 38).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 Data Layers for Above Ground Biomass (AGB) Data Set ( ID=38)\n",
    "- The species-agnostic Above Ground Biomass (AGB) baseline and predictive data layer ( ID=38000 ) \n",
    "- A species-specific Above Ground Biomass (AGB) baseline and predictive data layer ( ID=38002 ) \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> To run this notebook seamlessly, you have to first configure your Geospatial Analytics API credentials in a file named `secrets.ini` in the below format:\n",

    "```\n",
    "[EIS]\n",
