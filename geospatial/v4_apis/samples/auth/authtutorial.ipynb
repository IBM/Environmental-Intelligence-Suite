    "# Geospatial Analytics Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "The Geospatial Analytics component provides an API (at https://api.ibm.com/geospatial/run/na/). To use this you will also need an API key, a Tenant (or Client) Id and an Org Id. If you don’t have an API key, a Tenant (or Client) Id and an Org Id please contact your IBM representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter Notebooks that are part of this quick start tutorial we don’t include secret credentials. We read the credentials from a file named 'secrets.ini' when they are required as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import configparser\n",
    "\n",
    "config = configparser.RawConfigParser()\n",
    "config.read('../../auth/secrets.ini')\n",
    "\n",
    "EIS_ORG_ID     = config.get('EIS', 'api.org_id') \n",
    "EIS_TENANT_ID  = config.get('EIS', 'api.tenant_id') \n",
    "EIS_API_KEY     = config.get('EIS', 'api.key')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> If you do not have a tenant id you can instead set a client id (e.g. EIS_CLIENT_ID) and pass client_id = EIS_CLIENT_ID to the authentication.OAuth2 object init or the get_client() call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set these values in your secrets.ini in the below format before you start so that they are ready to be used when required:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[EIS]\n",
    "api.host = https://api.ibm.com/geospatial/run/na/core/v4\n",
    "api.key = <Your Geospatial Analytics API key>\n",
    "api.tenant_id = <Your Geospatial Analytics Tenant ID>\n",
    "api.org_id = <Your Geospatial Analytics Org ID>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep the secrets.ini file at an appropriate relative location of this notebook. For example, as specified in the below config.\n",
    "\n",
    "```config.read('../../auth/secrets.ini')``\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python3 \n",
    "\n",
    "The API tutorials are written in Python3. You can use any programming language by talking to the Geospatial Analytics HTTP endpoints using the standard HTTP libraries from your language of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use Python3 but don't have an environment set up including Jupyter notebooks there are many resources on the internet that can help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PAIRS Python API Wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebooks in this tutorial use the [ibmpairs](https://github.com/IBM/ibmpairs) API wrapper for convenience. You will need to install this into your Python3 environment. Make sure you have install at least version 3.0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more detailed overview of the IBM PAIRS Python API Wrapper [here](tutorial/pythonapiwrapper.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIP \n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install ibmpairs>=3.0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Auth token\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done with the setup, you'll have to make a call to ibmpairs' client module, by passing in your 'EIS_ORG_ID', 'EIS_TENANT_ID', 'EIS_API_KEY'. You'll have to specify the version of Geospatial Analytics that you want to get the client from (can be 3 or 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "EIS_client_v4 = client.get_client(org_id    = EIS_ORG_ID,\n",
    "                                  tenant_id = EIS_TENANT_ID,\n",
    "                                  api_key   = EIS_API_KEY,\n",
    "                                  version   = 4\n",
    "                                )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an activity the you need to perform before querying anything from the Geospatial Analytics but this is a one time activity for each query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see a detailed implementation or usage of the Authentication client in the other notebooks moving forward."
